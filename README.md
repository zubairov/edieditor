Smooks EDI Editor for Eclipse
=============

This is an improved version of Smooks EDI Editor for Eclipse.

It is now based on Smooks 1.5. This version includes following improvements:

* Migrated to the Smooks 1.5 (SNAPSHOT), which mean that if Smooks can parse your EDI file you can be pretty sure that Eclipse EDI Editor can do it too. It is consistent with Smooks 1.5 in reading and writing EDI files.
* Improved rendering of Component nodes in the editor (see screenshot below)
* Dynamically loading smooks mapping schemas from the mapping bundles generated by smooks, which are (with fixed MILYN-600) are acting as Eclipse plugins now.
* Bringing not only ability to edit UN/EDIFACT files but also contribute all XML Schemas for smooks EDI XML to the Eclipse, so you could edit and validate EDI XML.
